        <h1>William Shakespaw</h1>
        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>My name is William Shakespaw and I am applying for the position of Squirrel Defense Coordinator, but first, a little about me on a personal level. My favorite musicians are Snoop Dogg and Bow Wow, I eat steak for dinner 6 days a week, and swimming is my favorite form of exercise. Now that that's out of the way, on to my credentials. I have been involved in numerous secret raids on the postal service. I graduated top of my class at Good Boy School and have over 300 confirmed frisbee retrievals. I'm trained in vacuum warfare, am the top treat catcher in the entire United States, and am capable of barking in over 700 different tones. This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU953INhpqg" target="_blank">video</a> showing me diving to extreme depths to rescue a drowning comrade. Some of my most famous accomplishments are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Once chased 2 mailmen at the same time, each going in a different dirction</li>
          <li>Negotiated a peace treaty between the cats and dogs in my neighborhood, putting to rest decades of ongoing conflict</li>
          <li>Caught 5 treats in my mouth at once, blindfolded</li>
          <li>Successfully taught my owner how to play fetch, he now retrieves the newspaper for me each morning as well</li>
        </ul>
